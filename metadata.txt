description=create animations visualizing spatio-temporal data
version=2.1.7
about=TimeManager adds time controls to QGIS. Using these time controls, you can animate vector features based on a time attribute. There is also an experimental raster layer support and support for interpolation beween point geometries. You can create animations directly in the map window and export image series.
